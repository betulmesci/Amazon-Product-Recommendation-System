Recommendation System for Amazon Products

In this project, I have developed two recommendation systems for Amazon products based on customer reviews and product descriptions, 
using cosine similarity and word embeddings.

Data Set Description and Data Preparation

The data set used in this project consists of 10,000 fashion products sold in the UK through Amazon's website. The data was obtained 
from https://data.world/promptcloud/fashion-products-on-amazon-com/workspace/file?filename=amazon_co-ecommerce_sample.csv.

The text for each product was processed to obtain tokenized words by fixing contractions, removing stop words and punctuations. TF-IDF 
vectors were created, and cosine similarity of products was obtained. The top 10 most similar products were extracted for each product, 
and the related products were added to this list. Three filters were applied to this list of final recommendations:

    The top 5 products with the highest ranking in the best-selling list.
    The top 5 products with the highest ratings.
    Products that are in a similar price range as the product.

Recommender using Word Embeddings

In this approach, word embeddings were created using word2vec. For each word entered by the user, the five most similar words were obtained, 
and the products whose text consisted of these six words were selected as the most similar ones. These products were then ordered by their 
ranking in the best-selling list, and the top five products were chosen. They are displayed by their ratings.

Conclusion

The two recommendation systems developed in this project use different approaches to recommend products based on customer reviews and product descriptions. 
The cosine similarity approach is more specific to a particular product, while the word embeddings approach is more general and can be used to search for 
products using keywords.
